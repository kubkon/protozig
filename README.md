# protozig

Ideally, this will be a complete implementation of [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)
in [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

Initially, my focus will be entirely on a standalone protobuf to Zig translator. The syntax version I'll be focusing
on will be `proto3` (in the future, happy to add the previous `proto2` version too).
